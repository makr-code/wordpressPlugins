```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #2c3e50;
    --secondary-color: #3498db;
    --accent-purple: #7c4dff;
    --success-color: #27ae60;
    /* ... more variables */
}
```

You can customize these through the WordPress Customizer or by creating a child theme.

 Template:     themisdb
*/
```

```php
<?php
function themisdb_child_enqueue_styles() {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css' );
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'themisdb_child_enqueue_styles' );
